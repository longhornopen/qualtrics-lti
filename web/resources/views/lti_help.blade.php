    <h1>Qualtrics LTI Tool installation help</h1>
    <p>
        If you're seeing this, you've successfully installed the Qualtrics LTI tool.  Here's some information
        about how to integrate it into your LMS.
        <br><br>
        If you need some LMS-specific info that's not covered here, it may be described at
        <a href="https://github.com/longhornopen/laravel-celtic-lti/wiki/LTI-Key-Generation" target="_blank" class="body_link">https://github.com/longhornopen/laravel-celtic-lti/wiki/LTI-Key-Generation</a>

    <h2>LTI 1.3</h2>
    <p>
        LTI 1.3 is the preferred method to register this tool with your LMS.
    </p>
    <div>
    <p>
        ➔ First, set up your RSA public and private keys.
    </p>
    @if (env('LTI13_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY') && env('LTI13_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY'))
        <p style="border:solid 1px black; margin-left:20px; padding:10px;">
            <span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;font-size:120%">✓</span> Congratulations, looks like you already did this!
        </p>
    @else
        <p style="border:solid 1px black; margin-left:20px; padding:10px;">
            The file at <code>config/lti.php</code> contains the RSA info you need to provide.  By default, they're read
            from environment variables, which is preferred, but in a pinch you can hard-code values there.
            <br><br>
            Several web-based apps such as <a href="https://cryptotools.net/rsagen" class="body_link">https://cryptotools.net/rsagen</a>
            can generate RSA keys for you, or you can do it from the command line.

                        We don't currently have detailed instructions for other LMSes.  (Please contact us if you
                        can help write them!)  You'll need to set up the following, though:
                        <ul>
                            <li>JWKS URL: <code>{{env('APP_URL')}}/lti/jwks</code></li>
                            <li>All other URLs: <code>{{env('APP_URL')}}/lti</code></li>
                            <li>The Privacy level will need to allow reading student's names and submitting grades</li>
                            <li>LTI Advantage Services: the service to return grades to the LMS will need to be active</li>
                            <li>You'll need to get the app's Client ID, and the Deployment ID from an instance of the tool that you've deployed into a course.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                In a command line, <code>cd</code> to the top-level folder of the web app - the one containing the file `artisan`.
            </li>
            <li>
                Type <code>php artisan lti:add_platform_1.3</code>.  You'll get a walkthrough of further commands to run,
                which will be LMS-specific.  For all of them, you'll need the Client ID and Deployment ID you noted above.
                <ul>
                    <li>For instance, to install into Canvas: <code>php artisan lti:add_platform_1.3 canvas-cloud --client_id=12345 --deployment_id=XYZ</code></li>

    <h2>LTI 1.0-1.2</h2>
    <p>
        Qualtrics LTI still works with older versions of LTI, but those versions aren't recommended anymore.  Use the LTI 1.3 instructions above if you have a choice.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>cd web</code></li>
        <li><code>php artisan lti:add_platform_1.2 my_lms_name my_consumer_key my_shared_secret</code></li>
        <li>Install into LMS with launch URL: <code>{{env('APP_URL')}}/lti</code> and the consumer key/secret you created above.</li>
